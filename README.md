# 3D Map Customizer

A web app for customizing 3D printable rasterized maps. The output is a grayscale PNG image where the grayscale value indicates the max layer number.

### Supported 3D printers

The intention of this app is to produced rasterized images that can be easily converted to 3D printable files for MSLA and DLP based 3d printers. It also possible to convert rasterized height maps to triangulated 3D meshes that can be used by any available slicing program to produce a 3D printable file for any 3D printer, however this practice is not recommended due to file size limitations on mesh formats such as STL. To accurately reproduce the height map in the highest resolution possible would require an extremely high number of triangles which will quickly cause memory problems with most slicing programs.
